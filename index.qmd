Hello and welcome to my page! I’m Zoe Zheng, a graduate student with a deep-seated passion for AI and ML in Virginia Tech. Armed with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics, I'm currently advancing my expertise through a Master's in Computer Science, focusing on NLP and multimodal learning. I enjoy solving real-world problems and am very much a team player. My team has won first place consecutively in Virginia Tech's annual Data Fest and placed in the top 21%, receiving an honorable mention, at the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM).  My research experience includes multidisciplinary LLM pertaining, few-shot in-context prompt learning, and comprehensive information extraction from both text and image documents.

**This website is my digital space – a place where I want to display somewhat professionalism and creativity. Here, you'll find some machine learning blogs, my CV, notes and some thoughts.**
